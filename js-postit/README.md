## Environment Setup

This project uses [Modular Magic](https://docs.modular.com/magic/) for environment management. Follow these steps to set up:

1. First, ensure you have Magic Shell installed. If not, visit https://docs.modular.com/magic/ for instructions.

2. Activate the environment by typing:
>magic shell

3. Install opencv-python via pip (it is not managed by magic yet)
>pip install opencv-python

## Generate the map
>python map.py <the-map-image>
